## The Food Catalogue App
 
The food catalogue app can be used to keep a track of the food which can fall into two categories: spicy and normal, cooked by different chefs.

If the category is chosen as "Spicy food", we are given an option to choose the spice score of the food as a measure of how spicy the item is. If the category is "Normal food" we are required to add a reference type for the recipe.

<strong> The project is based on OOPs Object, Classes, Inheritance and Hierarchy concepts in Delphi - Pascal </strong>
